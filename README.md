# ATMVigilance
Cutting-Edge Smart Surveillance for ATM Security

The project makes use of an automatic teller machine (ATM) monitoring system, an intelligent system built on embedded technology that combines different video sensors to continuously monitor its environment in order to detect suspicious activities, such as physical attacks that could endanger security, fraud, and theft against the security guard and people using ATMs. It also highlights security and safety precautions that may be put in place through suitable surveillance to stop such assaults. This study examines several physical ATM attacks and outlines techniques for spotting intrusions, putting preventative measures in place, and notifying authorities via the GSM network.
