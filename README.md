# ATMVigilance
Cutting-Edge Smart Surveillance for ATM Security

The project entails the implementation of an intelligent surveillance system for automated teller machines (ATMs). This advanced system utilizes embedded technology and a combination of video sensors to provide constant monitoring of the ATM environment. Its primary objective is to detect and identify any suspicious activities that pose a threat to security, including physical attacks, fraudulent actions, and theft. By doing so, the system aims to enhance the safety of both ATM users and security personnel, ensuring a secure and protected ATM experience. Additionally, it covers safety and security precautions that might be put in place through effective surveillance to stop such assaults. This project examines the many types of physical attacks on ATMs and proposes ways to spot breaches, start preventative steps, and notify authorities through the GSM network. We also addressed the suggested system's implementation as well as the sensors and other necessary components. The suggested approach successfully raises ATM security to thwart upcoming assaults.
